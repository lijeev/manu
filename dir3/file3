✅ Green Card Process for H-1B Candidates
Step 1: Employer Sponsorship
You cannot apply for a Green Card on your own (unless under specific categories like EB-1 Extraordinary Ability or family sponsorship).

Your U.S. employer must initiate and sponsor the application.

🧩 Employment-Based Green Card Categories
Most H-1B holders fall under:

EB-2: Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability

EB-3: Skilled Workers, Professionals

EB-2 is faster but requires a higher level of education or experience.

🛠 Step-by-Step Process
1. PERM Labor Certification (by employer)
Timeline: 6–12 months

The employer must:

Advertise the job

Prove no qualified U.S. worker is available

File ETA Form 9089 with the Department of Labor (DOL)

✅ Once certified → move to I-140 stage

2. Form I-140: Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker
Filed by Employer

Purpose: Prove that the company can pay the wage and you qualify for the job

Timeline: 6–9 months (can be expedited in 15 days with Premium Processing)

3. Wait for Priority Date to Become Current
Your priority date is the date the PERM was filed.

Check the Visa Bulletin monthly for current dates:

Backlogs are common for countries like India and China.
(India EB-2 and EB-3 often have years-long waits.)

4. Adjustment of Status (I-485) or Consular Processing
Once your priority date is current:

✅ If you're already in the U.S.:
File Form I-485 (Adjustment of Status)

You can also file EAD (I-765) and Advance Parole (I-131)

✅ If you're outside the U.S.:
Go through Consular Processing via a U.S. embassy/consulate

5. Green Card Approval
Once I-485 is approved, you become a U.S. Permanent Resident and receive the Green Card.
