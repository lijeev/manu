H-1B to Green Card Key Tips
Start the process early (at least in the 4th year of H-1B)

PERM or I-140 was filed 365+ days before H-1B max-out

I-140 is approved but your priority date is not current

Would you like a tailored checklist or timeline based on your current H-1B status and country of origin?
